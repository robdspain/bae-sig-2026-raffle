Dear [Speaker Name],

Thank you so much for being a featured speaker at CalABA 2026! We're thrilled to have you join us for the BAE SIG sessions.

**Would you be able to contribute any of the following?**
- A copy of your published book
- Training materials or workbooks
- Gift certificates for your services
- Other items relevant to behavior analysts

If you're able to donate, please let us know:
1. What item(s) you'd like to contribute
2. Your preferred shipping address
3. Any special instructions

All donations will be acknowledged at the conference and in our SIG materials.

Thank you for considering this request!

Warm regards,
Rob Spain
