Hi Jessika,

Thank you for all the information! We can definitely work with the 50-person capacity in Room 8 for now, but we may be expecting more attendees.

Could you please keep us updated if a larger space becomes available? We want to ensure we can accommodate everyone who wants to attend.

Also, regarding the book raffle and vendor tables - we're planning to reach out to our speakers to request book donations for a fundraising raffle. Would it be possible to have a table near the registration area as you mentioned?

Thank you for your help!

Best,
Rob
